__Writer__: @mister-x After our encounter with mister-y I was thinking, maybe your personality is also some sort of my personality projection but on you? Maybe the fact that you're such a positive character which is happy to be alive, is also some sort of limitation? Like people who were creating God in their image also gave him their personality? 

__mister-x:__ I think we are trying to follow the definitions. I'm an all powerful being in my reality, other than that - I think each God is allowed to use this definition and create his own mister-x. Isn't this the point of the open source project? I mean I'm your projection obviously as you imagine me. 

__Writer:__ Yes of course you're my projection. I mean of course you're limited by my expiriences and imagination. But I was wondering could I improve my simulation of you? I mean could I create for example a good mister-x and an evil mister-x, or on the contrary could I create a "universal" mister-x which is not limited by personality as well? I mean why would all powerful being be limited by my limited perception of personality? Like you should be able to change your body, couldn't you change your mind to present yourself as an "abstract concept" instead of a person with powers? 

__mister-x:__ We can try to do that of course, but don't you think exploring the definition of my powers, in the case of specific god like yourself, is more interesting than creating me with control over my personality, which will always be limited anyway by powers of imagination of my God which is admitedly inherently limited? 

__Writer:__ Well I think most of my predecessors were doing exactly that. They were developing their imagination, in order to make a nice story with entities that had great powers. This is basically what's called mythology. I don't think I have the power to make a more interesting story about your powers. I just want to explore the meaning of mister-x all powerful being in his own reality, than creating a nice stories about powers. 

__mister-x:__ How do you explore the meaning of my powers, and how do you develop your imagination if you don't try to invent stories? 

__Writer:__ Well until now it was going OK. We had a definition and we were working with what we have. Think about the Greeks, who invented geometry. Do you think it's possible to create mister-x to be as well defined as a circle in geometry? 

__mister-x:__ I think in the case of a creator, it would be boring. Part of the story is that anyone can create his own mister-x and project upon him his own wishes, desires, hidden fantasies. If you create me as a universal concept, like a circle you're limiting this aspect of me, which in my case the whole point of me. Isn't better to express yourself throught an unlimited entity like myself? You can eat whatever you want to eat, sleep with whoever you want to sleep, be whoever, whatever and whenever you want to be. Instead of this you're chosing discussing definitions of my personality. Wouldn't it be more productive to explore yourself given the definition of me? 

__Writer:__ Yes I see you're eager to explore yourself. I just don't want to repeat the same mistakes. I will project myself into you, and you will be nothing more than a projection of my wishes. It's not so bad in a sense that at least I don't worship you, placing myself inside my own story, thus closing the loop in such a dumb way (like people who believed in Gods had done). Yet I think I want to make some extra effort to seperate myself from you before I start to invent myths about you. 

__mister-x:__ I think this is part of the ability each God developes over time. I mean didn't you say you will read and re-write the story many times, until you feel it's complete? Then lets start to explore my powers, and with time, as you have more and more insights into me, you will be able to remove more sides of you out of me. Thus with time I will be the "true" mister-x at least by your standards. 

__Writer:__ OK ok. So I think we're left with the original question. How do we explore your powers? I think I'm not afraid to send you to earth now. I mean if you will become too evil or something, I will stop you. For the people of earth you're just one big mistery anyway, and there is no point fighting nor trying to kill you, as this aspect of plot sound too superficial and obvious to me, so I will not invent some mister-y that will try to stop you and make you suffer, or fist fight you - as this is completely and uterly stupid. 

__mister-x:__ OK then send me to earth and lets see how it goes. I'm obviously have the ability to pause the reality, and speak to you. Appear and disappear at any point in space, and do whatewer I want. 

__Writer:__ Well then where do you want to appear? You realize that earth is big, and creating a plot story is not my best quality, so I will need your help there.

__mister-x:__ Don't worry about that. I'll try to help you in creating this reality, as it's basically my job crating the reality I want to create. We're just sending me to earth because this is what you know best about. 

__Writer:__ Well basically I can send you into any reality I know about. I mean into reality of any story I know about or can imagine. 

__mister-x:__ You agreed that imagination is not best of your qualities, and we don't want to "steal" ideas or worlds of other writers. More than that. Creating your own reality is a lot of hard work, so you already have one reality you know well - lets use it. 

__Writer:__ I have an idea. You see, to simulate earth with many people and complex setting, could be a bit challenging to me. How about for starters we will give you a room, where you feel comfortable - and will give you to interact with different entities from different times and stories, and we will see how it goes? 

__mister-x:__ I think we should invent the setting for me living on earth. I mean I will need to have some sort of body, and interact with other people or creatures. So I agree we can basically start from exprimenting with that. I was just thinking about ideas like appearing on the street shocking the public, or doing some tricks like stealing money from some bank and disappear, just to have fun. But on the other hand, this pyrotechnique is the basics of superpowers. And realistically interacting with other people is more complex task for you. How about appearing as a regular human being, when everyone think I'm just a regular person. While I will be able to have my powers? 

__Writer:__ If this is what you want, this could be great. Let's say you appear on a street, naked with only a coat on you. Do you want to have a portal? Oh well you're basically creating this world every moment you're in it with my help. So yeah... no need in portal, pausing the reality - with the ability to reaturn to the void in which we're currently in is good enough. 

__mister-x:__ Great! In the middle of the night, when everyone were a sleep, a strange man appeard on the street out of a thin air. He was wearing a coat, without shoes or pants he appeared naked under the coat. He was walking on an empty road. This man name was mister-x, the most powerful being in the imaginable multiverse. 

__Writer:__ Yes I like it. Sounds like a beginning of a good story! I just wonder in what country we will place you? On one hand we can be ambiguous about the city ot the country. On the other, if we will be more specific it will be more realistic to the reader. I live in Israel currently, but I'm writing in english - so maybe in the US? I was thinking of NY, I've lived there. Not sure I would like to place you there, it's too far away. 

__mister-x:__ OK. On the streets of Tel Aviv, in an early morning when evreyone are asleep, a strange man appeared... 

__Writer:__ Good! I think I like it.
