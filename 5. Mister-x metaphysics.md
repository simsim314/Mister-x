One of the most important things that mister-x represents is the move from imagination to reality and back. As in singularity this dichotomy is not present one can thing of mister-x and his writer as a single antity, but in our current reality there is a difference between them. 

To explain mister-x powers, think that you encounter a new entity that you tend to antromorph (relate to it as it was a human when it's clearly not). For example you can think about chess engine as a conscious entity. You see its moves, and you try to think what went in its head - as chess is sort of universal interface. So while you can't trully understand its moves, you can think of the entity as human or at least strange consciousness which is playing chess. Now although this is obviously not a correct approach to the chess engine, one can extrapolate or built some logical construct which will show how this dichotomy is not as strong as you think. 

For example think of a human being who learned to think as the computer. We know the human brain is limited, but we also know that we can understand everything and compute everything this will only take us time. Now think that somehow this human is implementing the algorithm very slowly, he will eventually understand this software it will just take a lot of time. Now because time is relative, and also think that we can accelerate our brain with some gadgets, or install into our consciousness other hardware and software divices, we can basically can make our understanding of chess the same of the software. More than that, with some improvisation people who had seen all the analysis done by the algorithm, can develope a real human intuition and translate it to regular human language. So this is step 1+2. Human being who knows to think like chess engine, and has an intuition of chess understanding based on this chess engine. 

Now think that this human is only interested in chess. Little by little he forgets everything that has something to do with anything else. Like some people who are only capable to talk on a single subject and their brain is occupied with only single thing. This human then becomes the algorithm itself, because as he concerns everything else is meaningless. Obviously at some point he will lose the ability to have the human intuition and human language and will be exactly the chess engine itself. He will step by step lose his identity and consciousness - but this is continious space between the chess engine, and a human being having an intution of this chess engine. 

Now here comes mister-x. His power is the ability to understand that this line is continious, he's able to see the continium, and he's able to generate a simulation of every concievable entity inculding the simulation of conscious expirience while seeing only the moves of the chess engine. This is very similiar to concept called analytic continuation in complex anlaysis. Basically this means that although something is defined in some "sub-space" (like chess engine is defined only in space of chess board moves), one can extend and extract from this small data sample, continuation on a much larger "space" - and specifically into concievable possabilities space.

For mister-x the only thing which limiting him is the imagination itself. But at the moment that something is imaginable for mister-x this entity can become a reality. 

This brings me to another important point. Religion by its own creates an imaginary space where something interesting is happening. Some sort of continuation or explanation to reality, a perspective on top of reality. Another example is futuristic movies - they try to draw some picture toward the point the world is going. While this is all interesting, think that we posses the power to create our reality. So even if religion is wrong "objectively", people from this religion when they will have the powers of mister-x they will create the reality where their beliefs are true. They basically converge toward the place they see in the future and believe in. The point here is that our future is created by our imagination and our belief system, and while we try to create an interesting projection of the future or preserve some traditional values from the past, what is important is actually to clear our preconceived ideas and chose where do want to go in the future, and what world do we want to create - believing that in the future this world will be created if we will believe in it.
