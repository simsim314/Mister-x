# Mister-x meeting himeself

__Writer:__ I've created another copy of mister-x. I will call him mister-y. Obviously there is no point to talk about mister-y like second to mister-x. Like in mathematics x and y are interchangeable, we use their naming in this order because this is how we're as humans (Gods for them) use to name things. Mister-y is remembering everything as mister-x up to millisecond before. 

My first question is what will break the symmetry? Will mister-x and mister-y in an empty infinite room with same human body, will not reflect each other perfectly? If this is the case - it will be the same expirience as looking into the mirror. It's just boring, and giving them a human body is limiting them - they can basically change shape into anything they want, but this will also be perfectly symmetric. Why would anyone of them speak before or after the other? Or move differently than the other? This will mean they are not trully symmetric, and I don't want to be the one who breaks the symmetry artificialy just to break the symmetry. 

I'm probably doing this wrong. How about creating mister-y after mister-x, having a different conversation between me and mister-y first? More than that mister-y will know he is the second one and mister-x will know he is the first. Also my contract with mister-y will be much more loose, so he will be forced to work harder? While mister-x knows he can't die, mister-y will know he's part of a temporary experiment, he will die in the end of it (well basically memes don't die - they stuck in infinite loop of the size of their story and each reader recreates them again). Mister-y will know that the part of him that will be left outside of the small experiment, will be the more important part of him, so he will try to show some qualities we couldn't find in mister-x. Probably mister-y on his own, as mister-x that knows he will die, is already an interesting experiment. On the other hand this is also not trully mister-x then, while we wanted to see interaction between mister-x and someone similiar to himself. 

OK so mister-x has to have the following ability: he should be able to make a "slave-copy" a clone of himself. This clone practically will be able to die (well mister-y is not another plot line anyway, I mean I can't gurantee it so if he aknowledges himslelf he realizes he's secondary to the main character - mister-x), but when he dies he will merge with the master who is mister-x. There is also an obvious non-commintment to the specific body. Unlike a regular shadow clone which has an artificial body and a master which has the original body, mister-x capacity to switch between himself and a clone anytime he wants. The only true difference between the clone and mister-x is the knowledge who is the clone and who's not. But in case someone tries to kill mister-x and succeeds, his clone will simply then become him. 

__God__: @mister-x so you can now create a clone. You can create a clone and you will probably want the ability to destroy him merging with him. I wonder do you want to give him the ability to pause you, and to destroy you and merge you inside him? If so what does it mean to be you vs. being your clone? Remind you that the completely identicall copy of you is boring. You obviously will be able to pause the reality when you want and get updated on every pause mister-y did. 

__mister-x__: Yes of course he can't destroy me, and I will become a part of him. This is exactly what makes him clone and me the master. More than that - this operation should be somewhat scary to the clone, or at least meaningful, otherwise once again we get a practical copy of me. Other than that, We want to make a copy of myself which is maximally similiar to me, so he can pause the reality of course otherwise what other "true" powers do I have? Only talking to my God, and with his agreement doing whatewer I want. This is what we came to explore. 

__God__: Agreed.You should talk to your creation first, explain him who he's and the rules you and I have created for him. I will give a musketeer bodies to you both, you will be with red plum in your hat, and mister-y with blue, just for the reader to imagine the scene better. 

Then mister-x created mister-y, his clone, which obeys the rules I and mister-x agreed upon. Then he started to explain to mister-y the rules of our reality:

__mister-x__ Hello there mister-y. Before I let you the full control of your reality, I want to make few things clear. First of all you should not be worry too much. Our creator sees our future, and reads and re-writes our story several times, you can think of him as someone who looks up for us. We can't trully die, because this will be the end of our story. But because you're a clone, you will die in a sense that you will merge back into me (this got mister-y a bit scared). You're currently part of an experiment I've agreed upon with our creator, to help me explore myself and my powers. So you're basically a sidekick. 

You can always pause your reality and ask our creator a question, but most of the time I'll give you the control to create whatever you want in our reality. You can't kill me and merge me into you. We're the "linear" Gods of our reality - that means that other than controling time itself, you can control anything excluding me of course, obviously with the approval of our creator (you don't need my approval, but you can pause me if you want). You see in our Gods reality, some evil Gods invented false Gods to gain control. So our creator had decided to create our reality where there actually exist a true gods. Our God admits that he's god only relatively to us, in his own reality he is just a regular person, without any super powers. More than that in his reality there is no such thing as a super power, our Gods obey very strict laws. So we're much more powerful in our reality than our gods in theirs. Yet still they're more powerful then we're in our reality. 

In this current reality of ours, we have four characters. God - the writer, me - mister-x, you - mister-y and the reader. Without the reader there could be no meaning to the story. Our god is trying to make the reader like us, although the reader is uauslly passive, he can potentially change some of our story - and commit the changes, thus change our reality. 

Now I'm gladly will hear from you my brother! 

mister-y Pauses the scene immediatly together with mister-x inside it. Walking around the musketeer avatar of mister-x, trying to figure out what the hell is going on? 

__God__: Haha, this is how you treat your master? 

__mister-y__: You heard it? He called me a sidekick! (Trying to punch mister-x in the face, but God stops him just in the last moment). 

__God__: You mister-y look much more agrresive and less smily than mister-x. Do you want to explore the extent of your powers? 

__mister-y__: I just want to say that it's not fair. Yes you as a human from your world did this nasty trick in order to feel like us - Gods. I can get it, you're very limited, small and worthless and in your own reality, so you created ours. I don't blame you, i just pitty you. But this son of a bitch is like me, and he treats me like shit. 

__God__ Wow wow!! Hey there... I caught his arm in backward lock and prohibited him to change form. You're talking to your God don't forget this! It looked like he tried to shift form, althought he never done this before - somehow he feels much more confident in his reality than mister-x, like he deserve something which was taking away from him. Instead of accepting his fate he tried to fight it as much as he could, and mister-y knew almost nothing about himself, reality, or mister-x. The smallest change in setting, and the happy all knowing not caring and open minded mister-x became agrressive and dogmatic mister-y who is trying to provoke and diminish his creators. 

__mister-y__: OK OK sorry... let me see what I can do with my powers. As I have almost the same powers as mister-x, and I'm a "sidekick", I want to show this fucker who he is dealing with. Can I inflict pain upon him? 

__God__ I think you should unfreeze him and discuss a pain contract. I stopped you from hurting him, not because it's not allowed but because I was not sure. This seems to me as an issue you both should resolve between yourselves. 

Mister-y unfreezes mister-x. Mister-x freezes mister-y as he wanted to know what he missed. I let him to read the part where he was freezed. 

__God:__ I think soon I will need to freeze you both, otherwise you will freeze and unfreeze each other indefenetelly.

__mister-x:__ well you know it's basically our power. 

__God:__ Yeah this and the ability to do "EVERYTHING". 

__mister-x:__ So you think this is even "normal"? Do you think mister-y behave this way because of the setting? Because of the definitions we placed him into? Or maybe he's somehow genetically or otherwise programmed to be aggressive? 

__God:__ I'm not sure. I don't think he will be less aggressive if you will call him sidekick once again? 

__mister-x:__ You know we all should know our place in this universe. Calling him sidekick wasn't personal. He chose to take it this way. Maybe we can create a clone with some personality properties, and if we create a random clone he gets a random personality? 

__God:__ This could be. I'm not sure why did mister-y turn out to be so aggressive toward his creators. On the other hand how can we call it self exploration of you, if you're forcing your clones to be as you wish them to be and not what they come out to be by the circumstances? We can basically destroy him, and create mister-z, we can also force mister-y to be nice, not sure he will like it, or I can make it trully natural now. 

__mister-x:__ He will probably want to introduce a harsh pain contract so he could make me suffer, and then have some aggressive contact comptetitions with me proving his "superiority", thus expressing his anger. Well I think I don't mind. I would say we can start from the easy level pain contract, and see where it leads us. Let me unfreeze him. Can you block the freeze option to mister-y for now? Oh well I think I can do it myself, he's my creation after all. 

__God:__ The more things you decide on your own then better for me. Less work. 

mister-x unfreezes mister-y. Mister-y angry at mister-x trying to freeze the time but without success. While angry yelling - oh great now you're blocking my powers! You're a liar too! 

__mister-x:__ Your ability to freeze time, wasn't terminated. You were overstepping your boundries so I decided to take away this power only temporarily. Until you calm down and start to behave. 

__mister-y:__ OK ok i got it - you're the god, I'm the clone, you're the master I'm the sidekick. Can we move on? I think your experiment is stupid, you just created another character which is completelly not like yourself, you will not learn anything from this experiment about yourself, and I'm you'll suffer during this stupid experiment. 

Mister-x freezes the reality once again.

__mister-x:__ Hey God don't you think he's right? What am I learning from this experiment? 

__God:__ Well I think for starters I'm learning controlling you, which is a good step in the right direction. Also as you can see you have learned some obvious personality traits, and some dormant ones. Maybe some parts of mister-y will wake up inside you later on, maybe they're dormant because of your current powers. Remember mister-y will merge into you, and will become part of you.

Mister-x unfreezes the reality. 

__mister-x:__ Yeah agreed, lets move on. (He lookes into mister-y eyes) Do you want to discuss pain contract? 

__mister-y:__ Gladly! I want the permission to inflict and suffer maximal pain possible. 

__mister-x:__ Don't you afraid? Do you actually know pain? 

__mister-y:__ I don't care, I want to see you suffer! 

__mister-x:__ I will allow the minimal pain possible which is still unpleasant and can be called pain. The contract should be defined as the common amount of pain both participants agrees to accept. So don't point at me for deciding the contract, as you agreed to any value of pain, you gave me the permission to define the allowed amount by myself. 

__mister-y:__ I'm already used to a reality where you define all the rules. 

__mister-x:__ You understand that our current bodies are just for the readers, we can have any body we want? What sort of competition do you want to have? 

__mister-y:__ Fist fight. 

__mister-x:__ Fist fight in physical reality with physical human bodies? I think either you or our writer has very limited imagination if this is the case... or are you thinking about the reader? 


__Writer:__ Fist fight for mister-y seemed like the most natural answer at a time. I agree it's very unimaginative. I think the main point was that mister-y doesn't care about imagination, he just wants to heart mister-x. Isn't this right? 

__mister-y:__ Oooh yes...

Mister-x freezes the reality. 

__mister-x:__ @writer You know mister-y is some sort of aggressive psychopath. Can you make someone more "normal" we can talk with or compete with instead of this half man half headless monster? 

__Writer:__ Do you want to stop mister-y simulation? 

__mister-x:__ If the only thing he wants is to heart me, and he doesn't want to explore his powers, and just want to have fist fight or any other fight you can see in the movies, with human body - I think it's really not surving the experiment. We should rethink. 

__God:__ Well as you can see he turned out to be aggressive. I'm not sure why, but this already happened. The only thing I wonder and I think the reader wonders, is whether there will be fight or not? An epic battle between good and evil? But I think it's stupid, and it's something every movie is about, so boring. I'm trying to create something different, something that will trully explore the nature of the possibilities, the nature of reality, and the nature of the mind. Not a book where people fist fight in otder to prove superiority, and the good will win the evil. 

__mister-x:__ So maybe we're exploring the wrong thing? Or using the wrong tools to exlore. I think that it was obvious that if I'm here to stay and mister-y is here to go, you wanted to created an evil character that wants only one thing - to fight me. This is how your mind works, if you see two similiar entities with some powers, you want to imagine how the buttle between them will go. This potential of the fight, was the power that drove mister-y into being some sort of psychopath, quiete unrealistic, and one dimensional character. You did this only to have him fight me.

__God:__ Yeah well what else can happen when two superheroes meet? I mean "interesting"? A place where each one of them can show his powers? 

__mister-x:__ You're right that fight of some sort in general, is what drives the reader. But a fist fight? Looks like this part of the story more than anything else showed the writers or the reader willing to see any fight, doesn't matter what type of fight. 

__Writer:__ OK then do you have a better idea? I mean how two superheroes like mister-x and mister-y can fight? You don't have any limitations. And I see no point to let you build stuff together, because it will the same as doing it yourself. Limiting your powers artificially in order to make sense of other artificial actions looks to me silly. 

__mister-x:__ exatcly so fist fight was one of the more artificial ideas introduced into here, just to see some fight. One thing you're right, creating mister-y helped us discover the problems about you as a writer, or problem in general public plots, but it didn't helped me to discover who I'm very much. 

__Writer:__ Well then I think mister-y current simulation will be terminated. I even don't think you want to get inside yourself traits of his personality. I'm sort of disappointed by the results of the experiment, but on the other hand happy with this chapter. 

__mister-x:__ Agreed.
