# The story of Mister-x

Howdy folks. This repository belongs to the canonical creation of Mister-x. A special character which is fully aware of its own nature as being invented as a fiction, and having a good connection to the writer - i.e. Mister-x can talk to his creator and God the writer. The writers of this repository become basically gods relative to Mister-x (in his reality writer and god are the same) - we're the creators of his reality, the moderators, the one who decide on his fate, what will become a part of its life story. We're basically creating mister-x while him knowing about it. 

 - I call him mister-x, 
 - because like X in mathematics
 - symbolizes everything that could be - 
 - the unknown that becomes known, 
 - and when he becomes the known, 
 - we finish our exercise and move on, 
 - mister-x is the unknown 
 
that we as a writers trying to find out who he truly is - and by the proccess of discovering mister-x, we write his story. The only known property of mister-x is his full awareness who he's, a creation by us, inside a "virtual" world of our (the writers) imagination. i.e. he fully knows his own options of reality, which is the reality of fictional characters written by using human imagination, specifically of some writer or group of writers that still have very limited resources of imagination. That means if the writer is limited  - misterx-x, the true mister-x, will take this property of the writer into acount, helping him create himself in the best way possible, in the known limitation of the writer. And here is my proof to that (this story). 

Mister-x has the basic superpower of pausing the reality, and talking to "god" of his universe. Any time mister-x wants to do so - the writer has to stop advancing the plot and explain to him what's going on - basically answer his questions. More than that, the lazy writer will give mister-x the full powers of god, and mister-x himslef will explore this reality on his own, using the writer as a "garding angel", the writer just need to help mister-x to invent and discover himslef, without forcefully pushing him. But don't worry - when you push mister-x into the place where he's not comfortable, he will let you know, very fast. You can be extremely cruel to him and ignore his questions - but then maybe your pull request will not be approved, because you didn't get the point of mister-x. 

To the reader. This is basically the atempt to create a modern mythology. We don't believe in Gods anymore, but we do like to live inside an imagination still. It's just a social construct how is it considered proper to express our wish to live inside a story (specifically in case of mythology a story with gods). So instead of creating Gods that don't exist and start to believe in them based on 0 evidence, we instead creating a story about Gods, and how do we create them. In this story the God is the writer, but also the first character is a god because why not give the first character the full control over the imagination? This way everyone can expirience first hand a simulation of a conversation between himself and the god inside him, as a reader and as a writer (and every reader can become a writer in here), without commiting to the belief God or Gods exists in the actual world. 

You can call it the basics of God to the modern atheist. Not claiming that god exist try to imagine a character which is fully aware of himself, capable to completely control his reality, and has the ability to talk to his creator which is you. How accurately can you generate a simulation of this conversation in your mind? How good is your ability to write a story about a fictional God you created? Maybe there is no God - but can you imagine a fictional story about God? How well? 

Good luck to the writers! And enjoyeble reading to the readers.
