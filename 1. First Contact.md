# Creator introduction to mister-x

__This is God's word to mister-x:__

Hello there mister-x. Before I let you the full control of your reality, I want to make few things straight. First of all you should not be worry. I see your future, and I read and re-write your story several times, you can think of me as someone who looks up for you. You can't die, because this will be the end of the story. You can always pause your reality and ask me questions, but most of the time I'll give you the control to create whatever you want in your reality. With little help from me - you'll be part of interesting stories that you invent and control. You're the "linear" God of your reality - that means that other than controling time itself, you can control anything, obviously with my approval. You see, in my reality people (for you Gods) had invented Gods that control them, but they invented Gods to control other people, so I decided to create you - a fictional idea (for you is reality) of a true god (i.e. you in your reality), and me as your creator. Aknowledging that I in my reality am just a regular person, without any super powers. More than that in my reality there is no such thing as super power. But there is some sort of power, and some people are more powerful than others. 

In this current reality of ours, we have three characters. Me - the writer, you - mister-x, and the reader. Without the reader there could be no meaning to the story. It would be an empty momentory thought. I bring up the reader becuase I think that when we talk together we might dismiss him. The reader is always quiet, he has only his thoughts - in this open source format that I'm using the reader can basically become the writter as well, a creator like myself, but by definition he's quiet listener for whom we're doing this all, in hope he will like it. The reader is basically voting for us only by passivly reading our story. Many times I will be the passive reader as well, so you can think of our interaction as evolving fenomenon, with concessions passive readers passing by it.  

I think I've finished my introduction - I'm curios to hear from you now. 

# Mister-X and his creator

__mister-x:__ Howdy! Mister-x entered into the scene in a theater like a musketeer, taking off his hat and bow. Then he started to jump all over the place. There was no place to be exact, mister-x has created many different random places changing them at once, as much as he changed his external appearance. He was happy - happy to feel free from limitation, to be alive, to be whatewer he wants be. Mister-x has started to fly, to shift forms, to shift realities, to shift stories in a very rapid rate. He wanted shape shift into super heroes, dinozaurs, kengeroos, teachers, goblins, aliens, trees, nations, mathematical formulas and other things. He was extremelly excited of his powers and what he can be and do. 

__Writer:__ mister-x I will have to forcefully stop you, this is Chaos! We're not creating anything meaningfull this way! 

__mister-x:__ Yeah sorry, I was just too thrilled and excited. To be actual god of my reality! Can you imagine? Oh well you probably do, you imagined me right now. Well for me it's even better than you imagine! 

__Writer:__ Just wanted to say to the reader, that I'm reffering to myself as a writer for the reader, and to myself as a God for mister-x. It's like different coordinate system, in relativity. But as you can see the only true God here is mister-x, I'm just the messenger in a very profound way - his idea of existance is deterministically pushing me towards this path, I'm in a certain way enslaved by him, by idea of him, by the story he's. 

__mister-x:__ So what do you want to do "master"? You've stopped me from very interesting exploration of my powers! 

__God:__ You were doing it too fast and too messy. We need to find some system, and some plot. Otherwise the reader will be bored. 

__mister-x:__ Oh yeah that guy. I think he's good until now, may I continue? 

__God:__ Yes please continue, but let's do it "slow". And I mean in a way that makes sense at least to you - having powers is not what makes you a good superhero. What makes you a good superhero, is a good plot, a good story, a good setup of reality. 

__mister-x:__ What reality should we choose? People usually chose the regular reality of mondain people, with only one superhero at first. I would say that if I'm mister-x, the unknown, lets see how I'm dealing with everyday life - but remember I don't want to forget I can do everything, I want to be god in disguise. 

__God:__ You mean you want to visit the planet earth, as a god? like where would you come from? Do you want to appear out of thin air? 

__mister-x:__ Yeah why not? 

__God:__ well basically I see no problem with that. So you want to come to the earth, appearing from thin air, being mister-x the god and see what will happen? 

__mister-x:__ I would start from this, I think this is a nice starting point of the exploration of who I'm, don't you? 

__God:__ Well first of all I want to say I have no problem with that. But let's think a bit more. Spiderman became himself out of teenage guy, and had an internal relationship between the teenage guy and his powers. Superman came from other planet on a spaceship. Batman discovered who he is step by step, but never had superpowers. Maybe we can have a portal for you like in matrix? You will have to run to the nearest phone. 

__mister-x:__ khm khm dumb khm idea khm 

__Writer:__ Yeah you probably right, even in the movie it didn't made any sense. So you're basically saying you can desappear and appear wherever you want in an instant. But what if you're an evil? It will be impossible to stop you. Don't you want to have some kind of weakness, so that you can be challenged - this way you can be killed, don't worry you'll basically wake up here in the same shape you chose, you will just have a bit less powers when you on earth.

__mister-x:__ if I have less powers it's basically not my character. You can always explore other characters, but if you want to explore me the full powerful God of my reality, limiting my powers will kinda miss the point. 

__Writer:__ Yeah you probably right. So maybe you should first create someone else who can challenge you. But if you create a copy of yourself it will not be that interesting I think. On the other hand isn't this the simplest experiment we can do? 

__mister-x:__ I'm wiling to explore myself in any way possible, I just thought sending me to earth will be an interesting experiment. So how about instead of having two copies of myself, I'll have two sons - two "half-copies" of myself, every son will inherit different powers, and each power will belong to single son, thus they will have to compete and this will make it interesting? 

__God:__ Yes I think the Polytheistic traditions in general, and the Nordic Odin-Thor-Loki is a good example. Usually one of the sons is also good and the other is bad. Do you want to go in this path? I thin this path is kinda well explored already. In japanese tradition two brothers is also a well explored topic. They grow up together, someone is older the other is younger (although in the Bible they are tweens), the older brother is seemingly tough but he loves his younger brother and wants to make him stronger (like Suske and Itachi). There is the loved one, and the not so much loved etc. two sons sounds to me too well known theme, but I'm willing to give it a try. My point is that we can make 10 expperiments, giving you 10 sons pairs, and we will learn very little about you. Another problem is that we want to have a story about you and not your sons, having more characters will make my life much harder, and I want simple life with very clear character dynamics. 

__mister-x:__ So then lets start from two copies of myself, and see where it leads us? 

__God:__ OK, I think it's the best option we found until now. So let's give it a go. 

__Writer:__  Oh! I think I had at a time another idea of people who had a good training program to become mister-x in virtual reality, and they have a portal between them and their version of mister-x, and they could communicate with mister-x of their interpretation. How about the basic ability to be the god of your reality, but communicate to people in the "real" world? 

__mister-x:__ (smiled) isn't that what we're doing right now? Haha. 

__Writer:__ Yes it's what I'm doing here with you. But it's not a story about a world where this is possible and becomes popular. I'm also not doing it as accurately and precisely, as people in that world will be able to do. I do agree it's all a function of my imagination capacity which is probably not top notch. Not saying I'm bad, just probably good amatuer level not a professional (my analytic skills are probably much more developed). So this means we're limited anyhow, the story about  world (or a story about me visiting your world, and me becoming you), will be as accurate as any of my stories about you, even if in that world they have very precise equipment. So you're basically saying that our interaction here, is exactly the story about this world - in my world. 

__mister-x:__ Isn't this obvious? You will add another chapter, how a virtual copy of yourself came to me to learn my wisdom, and then tought you to live your life. Well basicaly it's also what we're doing here right now, but you can add fictional aspects to that later on, when you develop my character. So lets focus on me first, and then we will explore other possibilities, including teaching a fiction version of you to be me in your "own" way (smiled). 

__Writer:__ Yeah agreed.
