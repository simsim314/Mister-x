On the streets of Tel Aviv, in an early morning when evreyone were asleep, a strange man appeared out of a thin air. He was wearing a coat, without shoes or pants he appeared naked under the coat. He was walking on an empty sidewalk. This man name was mister-x, the most powerful being in the imaginable multiverse. This was Friday eve or Saturday early morning, no one works. The only people with cars are bicyclists, that woke up early in the morning to ride a bicycle - everyone else were sleeping usually after a party night, and some after a long week in the office. A small line of bicyclists stopped to by some food near some am/pm. There was a line in the store and two friends parking nearby were standing and waiting for their turn. Mister-x was behind them, he was also buying a dring, although obviously not to ride a bicycle. 

Yosi was tall and thin in his mid 20s, while Shimon was a bit shorter and older somewhere in his 30s. They were discussing the existance of God. 

__Yosi:__ You know, I would gladly believe in God if I would be presented with evidence. 

__Shimon:__ But the point of God is to believe in him, not to know his existance. 

__Yosi:__ If you call belief as the power to accept reality based on no evidance, then this is not a virtue. 

__Shimon:__ I'm claiming that the decision whether this is a virtue or not will define your belief, and the decision is not based on any evidence. You have chosen your philosophy, and this is legitimate choise. My point is that you're missing this act of choice, trying to say that this is the only rational way to solve the puzzle of existance. While I agree this is a legitimate way to see the world, I don't think your way is the only reasonable way to do so. One can chose to believe, and this will be his choise. 

__Yosi:__ I've not chosen this philosophy the same way I've not chosen not to fly. I would gladly believe I could fly, but I can't. I can't believe in that because I know how the nature works, I know the laws of flight, I know that making wind with my hands will not make me fly even if I practive for decades. The rational way of viewing the reality is not something we chose, but something which is emposed on us by the same thing which emposes on us our reality. 

__Shimon:__ I see what you mean. I agree that the belief you can fly is not rational - you can even check it and dispprove it to some very high extent. Yet my claim is that there are some much more basic axioms that lie underneath of the objective reality, that you can interchange and within the limits of facts, explain them in very different and legitimate ways, although maybe not equally probable. I mean we have our belief system, and we use facts to dissprove or approve our world view. Usually we come up with some sort of system to fit the fatcs we're getting from the reality, and our internal consrtuction of beliefs how our reality works. 

__Yosi:__ My claim is that God is not necessary concept, he doesn't explain anything. You can play with words as much as you like, eventually there are things which work, and which are not. Those things which don't work I don't care about, and the things which work they work because of some logic which lies behind them, some internal structure that we try to grasp as humans and build technology. 

__Shimon:__ Once again I'm not saying that you're not right. I'm just claiming that you're giving one solution to a puzzle which has many solutions legitimate in some extent. Even if you solution is the "best" solution, your solution is still another solution in a wast number of solution

__Mister-x:__ Excuse me gentelman. I couldn't overhear your talk - I think you both have a very legitimate point. The same points were made by anctient Babylonians and Greeks thousand of years ago.
